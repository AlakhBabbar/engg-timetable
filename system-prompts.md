Lets Completely Shift all the Buisness logic from frontend to backend. But lets go Step by Step. Now after auth I wanna do the same with TeacherManagement also okay? Only change/update the files as requested dont touch any other files. I have attached the Backend Folder SuperAdmin folder and the Auth folder for your reference.

Also note across the whole app, I am using Firebase only for auth and UserManagement. Remaining i am using Appwrite.
Also note to produce production level code.


Seperate the Buisness logic to the service file from the JSX file.
